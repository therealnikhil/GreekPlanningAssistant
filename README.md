# GreekPlanningAssistant
A revolutionary tool to enhance collaboration and coordination in fraternities and sororities nationwide.

## Introduction

Greek life is huge in universities across the nation, especially so at Purdue. Every semester we see thousands of students pledging to sororities and fraternities. While a lot of people see sororities and fraternities as a group of people having fun and partying, there are a lot of responsibilities involved with budgeting, gaining or maintaining popularity, philanthropy, brotherhood/sisterhood, maintaining good academic standing etc.

When a group of a couple hundred students have to coordinate all of this, it becomes very crucial how they communicate and get things organized. As a friend of many students in fraternities and sororities, and as a former member myself, I can say with certainty that there are many times the lack of effective communication among brothers/sisters has caused a lot of issues and arguments, and things going out of hand.

Greek Planning Assistant is a tool that will help make planning and collaboration within a chapter, and between different chapters in a university, much simpler.
